# Bkash
bkash is one of the most popular mobile banking platforms in Bangladesh. bkash app is perfectly fine to track down the cash in or out. But the problem arises when I am not connected through the internet.  Like, in the facebook e-commerce model someone ordered a product from the page and send the money via bKash. But the seller forgets to check the message or in-app. But the customer is getting a bad user experience in that. On the other hand, I can't find any free bKash API to send my transaction details to my own e-commerce or systems.  

On that note, I tried to scrap the bKash message and show it in a recycler view. And it's free of cost. Feel free to check and if you like to give it a  star. Any kind of contribution is highly appreciatable.
